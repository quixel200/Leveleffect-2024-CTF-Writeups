This is for the Zig.exe binary!

Personally I did not understand the question at all and had to spend a hint...
It says a number of system check occurs, I thought the first check was the answer but the answer is the number of checks that occured.
I had to message someone on discord and go through my notes for it to finally click.

when the binary runs, we see this on the output:
```
System check #1 complete
System check #2 complete 
System check #3 complete
```
so 3 in total.
