# My Lament 

This is for the Zig.exe binary!

I would have screamed this had I exited in such a way. (first 6 characters is fine!)

I first looked through the zig binary in ida and then ghidra, but found nothing of interest.
Then I remembered that we have another exe we can look at: rundlll32.exe
Originally I found the answer on ghidra, but strings is a much easier way and I don't remember where I found it in the binary.
