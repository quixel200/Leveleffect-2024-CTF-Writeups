I am newly scheduled. What event ID am I?

I googled for 'newly scheduled event id' which led me to this microsoft page:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4698

`This event generates every time a new scheduled task is created.`

`flag: leveleffect{4698}`
