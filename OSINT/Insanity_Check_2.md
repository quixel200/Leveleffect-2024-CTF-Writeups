# Insanity check 2 

You know the deal - join the disc, make sure your eyes work, don't go crazy.

Did you make sure there were no other flags in the Discord?

so I searched the entire discord and found this 'fake flag'

![fake flag](/images/fake_flag.png)

Now I tried submitting the fake flag..and it turned out to be fake.
I was doing this on my mobile at the time and thought, maybe im just mistyping something, let me copy paste it somewhere...
and the real flag was there.
