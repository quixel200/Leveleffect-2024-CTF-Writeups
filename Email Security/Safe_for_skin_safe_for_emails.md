#  Safe for skin safe for emails...

I keep more than your skin safe. ðŸ˜ƒ
hint: This is one of the key email authentication protocols (and also a number on sunscreen!)

Googling for email authentication protocols, I was able to find the answer quite quickly. There are four important email authentication protocols:
- SPF
- DKIM
- DMARC
- BIMI

now the hint says its also a number on sunscreen, which narrows it down to SPF, which is our flag.

`flag: leveleffect{SPF}`
