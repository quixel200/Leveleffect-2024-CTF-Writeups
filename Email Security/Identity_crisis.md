# Identity crisis

We've been tricked, lied to, and quite possibly, bamboozled.

Who is the actual sender of this phishing email? (provide the email address)

looking through the file I found this:
`From: "Dorsey B. Deyette" <bartholomewbelet810@gmail.com>`

the actual sender of the mail is barthalomewbelelet810, which is the flag.

`flag: leveleffect{bartholomewbelet810}`
