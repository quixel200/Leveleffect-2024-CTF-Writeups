I googled for "long-cultivated cyber espionage tool deployed by Center 16 of the FSB" and the first articule that showed up was this:
https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-fsb-malware-snake-takedown/32407612.html

reading throught the article, heres the bit we want:
```
Snake was first developed in 2003 or 2004 by Center 16, and early versions included an image of an ancient symbol called an Uroboros -- also spelled Ouroboros -- in which a dragon or snake is shown eating its own tail. Some of the code also included the string "Ur0bUr()sGoTyOu#"â€” in which the word "uroboros" is partly visible.
```

the answer is uroboros!
